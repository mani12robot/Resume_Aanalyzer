# Task: Build AI-Powered Resume Analyzer & ATS Scoring System

## Plan
- [x] Step 1: Design System Setup
  - [x] Update index.css with professional blue color scheme (#2563EB primary, #F8FAFC background, #1E293B text)
  - [x] Ensure all semantic tokens are properly defined for enterprise-grade UI
- [x] Step 2: Database Schema & Backend Setup
  - [x] Initialize Supabase
  - [x] Create storage bucket for resume files (PDF/DOCX)
  - [x] Create database tables (analyses table with resume data, job description, ATS score, analysis results)
  - [x] Set up RLS policies for public access (no auth required)
- [x] Step 3: Edge Function for AI Processing
  - [x] Create edge function for resume analysis
  - [x] Implement PDF/DOCX parsing logic
  - [x] Integrate OpenAI API for intelligent extraction and analysis
  - [x] Implement ATS scoring algorithm
  - [x] Return structured JSON with all required fields
- [x] Step 4: TypeScript Types & API Layer
  - [x] Define types for resume data, analysis results, ATS scores
  - [x] Create API functions in @/db/api.ts for database operations
  - [x] Create service layer for edge function calls
- [x] Step 5: Core UI Components
  - [x] Create main analyzer page with upload area
  - [x] Build file upload component with validation (PDF/DOCX, size limits)
  - [x] Create job description input component (textarea)
  - [x] Build ATS score display component with progress indicator
  - [x] Create analysis results display with sections (matched skills, missing skills, recommendations)
- [x] Step 6: Integration & Workflow
  - [x] Connect upload to storage bucket
  - [x] Implement analysis trigger and loading states
  - [x] Display results with proper formatting
  - [x] Add error handling and user feedback
  - [x] Implement analysis history view
- [x] Step 7: Polish & Validation
  - [x] Ensure responsive design (desktop-first with mobile adaptation)
  - [x] Add proper loading states and skeleton screens
  - [x] Implement comprehensive error handling
  - [x] Run lint and fix all issues

- All AI processing must be server-side via Edge Functions
- Use OpenAI API for reliable structured JSON output
- Professional blue color scheme: #2563EB primary, #F8FAFC background, #1E293B text
- Support PDF and DOCX formats only
- File size limit: 5MB
- ATS score range: 0-100
- Enterprise-grade, minimalist design
- Desktop-first responsive design
- All tasks completed successfully
- Lint passed with no errors
